Objective: Practice using increment and decrement operators in JavaScript.

*Instructions:* Write a JavaScript program that demonstrates the 
use of both increment and decrement operators on a variable.
 Follow these steps:
1. Initialize a variable `count` with an initial value of 10.
2. Use the increment operator to increase the value of `count` by 1.
3. Display the updated value of `count`.
4. Use the decrement operator to decrease the value of `count` by 1.
5. Display the updated value of `count`.

Make sure to add comments to clarify the actions performed 
at each step and the resulting values of .*/

let count = 10;
console.log(count); /* I diciler value with 10 */
count++;
console.log(count); /* It add value 1 by using incriment rule */
count--;/*Its decriment rule which assist to decrease 1 value from x varible */
console.log(count);
