/*Assignment 1: Arithmetic Operations*
Objective: Practice using arithmetic operators in JavaScript.

Instructions:* Create a JavaScript program that calculates the following:
1. The sum of two numbers.
2. The difference between two numbers.
3. The product of two numbers.
4. The result of dividing one number by another.
5. The remainder when one number is divided by another.

Include comments to explain each operation and the expected results.
 Ensure that your code is clear and easy to understand.*/

//  1. The sum of two numbers.
let x = 3;
let y = 6;

let sum = x + y;
console.log(sum);

// 2. The difference between two numbers.
let num1 = 3;
let num2 = 2;
let diff = num1 - num2;
console.log(diff);


// 3. The product of two numbers.
let multiply = 4;
let multiply2 = 5
let mulipicilation = multiply * multiply2;
console.log(mulipicilation);



// 4. The result of dividing one number by another.
let xx = 6;
let yy = 2;
let divide = xx / yy;
console.log(divide);

// 5. The remainder when one number is divided by another.
let a = 4;
let b = 2;
let c = 3;
let abc = a % b;
let xyz = a % c;
console.log(abc);
console.log(xyz);
