/*Assignment 1: Arithmetic Operations*
Objective: Practice using arithmetic operators in JavaScript.

Instructions:* Create a JavaScript program that calculates the following:
1. The sum of two numbers.
2. The difference between two numbers.
3. The product of two numbers.
4. The result of dividing one number by another.
5. The remainder when one number is divided by another.

Include comments to explain each operation and the expected results.
 Ensure that your code is clear and easy to understand.*/
//  1. The sum of two numbers.
var x = 3;
var y = 6;
var sum = x + y;
console.log(sum);
// 2. The difference between two numbers.
var num1 = 3;
var num2 = 2;
var diff = num1 - num2;
console.log(diff);
// 3. The product of two numbers.
var multiply = 4;
var multiply2 = 5;
var mulipicilation = multiply * multiply2;
console.log(mulipicilation);
// 4. The result of dividing one number by another.
var xx = 6;
var yy = 2;
var divide = xx / yy;
console.log(divide);
// 5. The remainder when one number is divided by another.
var a = 4;
var b = 2;
var c = 3;
var abc = a % b;
var xyz = a % c;
console.log(abc);
console.log(xyz);
