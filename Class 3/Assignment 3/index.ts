/*Assignment 3: Assignment Operators*
Objective: Practice using assignment operators in JavaScript.

*Instructions:* Create a JavaScript program that performs the following assignments using different assignment operators:
1. Initialize a variable `x` with a value of 5.
2. Add 3 to `x` using the addition assignment operator.
3. Subtract 2 from `x` using the subtraction assignment operator.
4. Multiply `x` by 4 using the multiplication assignment operator.
5. Divide `x` by 2 using the division assignment operator.

Include comments to explain each assignment and 
the resulting value of `x` after each operation*/

let x = 5;  /*in this line i dicilear variable "x" with value 5.*/
console.log(x);
x+=3; /* now i add 3 in x variable by using incrimental rule*/
console.log(x);
x-=2; /* now i minus value 2 in x variable my using decimental rule */
console.log(x);
x*=4;/* now it is multiplication rule, x variable muliply with 4 bt using multiplication assignment rule*/
console.log(x);
x/=2; /* 2 is divided with x value by using division assignment operator. */
console.log(x);
